# Machine-Learning
---
**Some machine learning models implemented by Python + Numpy.**

*With a lot of work to be done...*

1. [Linear Regression](linear-regression)
	- Implemented training method:	
		- **Batch gradient descent**	
		- **Normal equation**
		- **Newton method**
	- The testing program is for a simple regression problem, finding the relationship between **house price** and **living area**.
2. [Logistic Regression](logistic-regression)
	- To be modified...
3. [Naive Bayes](naive-bayes)
	- Testing program: a simple spam email classifier based on data with straightforward features.
4. [Neural Network](neural-network)
	- Implemented a simple neural network with a single hidden layer.
	- Implemented **error back-propagation** algorithm for training.
	- *Numpy* used for convenience of calculation.
